# Replication in R of "Algorithms for Inverse Reinforcement Learning" (Ng and Russell, 2000)

In this repo:

✅ IRL function (lp_irl_function.R)

✅ [IRL in finite state spaces with a simple example (example1.R)](https://rpubs.com/colleenobriant/irl1)

✅ [IRL in large state spaces (example2.R)](https://rpubs.com/colleenobriant/irl2)

Coming soon:

🚧 IRL from sampled trajectories
